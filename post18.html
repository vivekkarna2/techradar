            <p>the original surface computer may not also be a 12 months antique but, but that doesn’t imply that we are able to’t get excited for its sequel, does it?

in this text, we’d like to put out our expectations for what the surface pc 2 will look like. regardless of how a lot we love the authentic, home windows 10-powered floor computer, there’s continually room to improve.

with the windows 10 april 2018 replace, the floor laptop has get entry to to a ton of productiveness-focused capabilities, making the returned to high school perspective extra compelling – and we count on the surface laptop 2 to comply with healthy. however, while are we able to count on the floor pc 2 to arrive? well, now that microsoft is actively checking out and developing redstone 5, and its enterprise is booming, we could be seeing a surface laptop 2 declaration quickly – especially with the rumored 2019 redesign of the floor pro.
</p>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post(18).jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            <p>keep in thoughts, although, that we don’t have any concrete statistics about the surface laptop 2. nevertheless, that doesn’t mean we will’t speculate, so that’s what we’ll do. we’re going to appearance over the important thing floor laptop 2 info, like feasible features, launch date and charge. we’d also want to create a few sort of desire list. so, preserve this page bookmarked, as we’ll hold it updated with all of the modern-day records.

lamentably, we understand next to not anything regarding when we’ll see the following floor computer from microsoft. so, that leaves us with the release of final yr to base any hypothesis upon.

the first floor pc got here out in june 2017 in the us. now, microsoft seems to love to alternate between extraordinary floor devices year after 12 months, so that could lead us to believe the surface laptop 2 might be coming out in 2019. but, we haven’t heard anything approximately any surface hardware thus far this 12 months, so whatever is at the table. right now, we’d must positioned our finger on october being the subsequent feasible time to push out a surface computer 2.

granted, microsoft hasn’t been enormously constant with the release timings of its surface pro or floor e-book products. so, maybe we’ll see an statement inside the subsequent couple weeks in time for the again to highschool 2018 season, however a september or october release date is some distance more likely. 

once more, there has been little to no data concerning the floor computer 2 price. so, we handiest have the modern model’s pricing to head off of.

with that, we know that floor computer nowadays begins at $799 (around £560, au$1,000), a brand new configuration presenting a lower-electricity intel center m3 processor. the authentic beginning model, in the meantime, starts at $999 (around £705, au$1,250).

so, if we are to peer a floor pc 2 in 2018, it’s difficult to expect microsoft to deviate a ways – if in any respect – from this price in either course.</p>
